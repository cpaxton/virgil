# This is the proof of concept for the simple quiz maker. It uses an LLM to generate a quiz based on a user's input.

Enter something to make a quiz about.

You are generating a weird personality quiz titled, "{topic}".

There will be 5 multiple-choice options per question: A, B, C, D, and E. At the end, you will also provide a categorization: if the quiz taker chose mostly A, for example, you will describe what A is, and give a description.

You will also give a prompt for an image generator associated with each question.

For example:

Topic: What kind of sandwich are you?
Question 1:
Question: What is your favorite color?
Image: a sandwich with a red tomato, a green lettuce leaf, and a yellow cheese slice.
A. Red
B. Blue
C. Green
D. Yellow
E. Black
END QUESTION

End each question with "END QUESTION". Provide no other output.

The quiz is about {topic}.

Topic: {topic}
